The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily madeI have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhereI decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectlyYou really will not be disappointed with these
I bought these to go from my board to the amp We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating They are still going strong
Sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value I dont require professional-level equipment so this cord serves my purposes well Satisfied with purchase
Use it every week at gigs  Solid no problems with the solder joints  A good quality cable at a very good price
Hosa products are a good bang for the buck I havent looked up the specifications but Im guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG but since its only 10 long its good enough
This was exactly what I was after I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals
I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational Good price here too Hard to find just 10 mike cords Usually longer ones are only obtainable
This cable seems like it will last me for a while As it is only being used to connect a DI box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do
These are not the greatest but theyre cheap and they get to you fast when you need them Ive only had one fail and Ive bought many of them to use in our broadcast studioAmazon is the first place I go when I need cables for audio video computers or concert lightingGood music to all 
This is a fine cable at a decent price point nothing exceptional mind but it gets the job done well enough
Ive used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market
I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I shouldve known better than to buy My son who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacementI bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellentAn excellent value for the money
Nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp
