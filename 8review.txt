So far Im very happy with this Microphone Tone quality is fine and does everything I need it to do for backup vocals in my band Although a longer cable would be nice its great a cable and was included in the package
It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isnt a Shure SM58 This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s I was considering the SM48 but the PG58 has slightly better specs and almost identical priceThe first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier It also has a different switch than the SM58 The metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical I tried both mikes one after the other first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar and then I changed the settings or more specifically the effects and the EQ on the PA I repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikesHeres what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence They are about equal on volume The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal popI havent tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice as its too time consuming and interferes with playing Its difficulty to judge in those situations too or at least awkward but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58 but that could be just the settingsI looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side The SM58 is a little flatter in response especially at the high end over 10K Hz and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58 somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz However since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz neither of these seems likely to have much effect although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singerI also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM) The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued though and replaced with the 1800XM an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup not even taken out for practice The model number is 333001 probably also discontinued This was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and toneI didnt have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard They ARE sturdy and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable at around $100 However there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable at lower prices including the Shure PG58 and most likely the SM48 though I didnt have any of those to testI wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer Im giving this 4 stars only because I havent had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58
This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar I sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely I dont think it is the same as an SM58 but it is exactly what I need Built to last and it is a Shure
Just got this have used it for recording and rehearsal it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years  Right now though Id say great product
I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900 Its a big step up from that one I am pleased with it The old one had a lot of handling noise This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it My next one will be an SM58 but that will be awhile from now Im very happy with this PG58Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider It would keep me from buying another one of these Other mics I own dont have this problem to this degree
I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58  Id probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 Gs simply isnt that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks  But with respect to the Shure Im less sure that the SM58 isnt worth 40% more than the PG58  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently highpowered and \clean\ amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice the two mics could be mistaken for one another  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency PA that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58  Switching to the more common admittedly more expensive mic gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements)PS I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58  Since the rise of the \digital audio workstation\ (who doesnt have a computer with free included Garage Band on it) large even goldplated expensivelooking but cheap mics are on display all over the place  Despite appearances when it comes to mics size doesnt matterexcept for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap halfway around the face knowing that the girls in the frontline think theyre coolthey look just like Madonnaa or Janets headgear) Some of the best mics are tiny with an opening the size of a pinhole
good mic for simple live stuff that isnt too expensive  it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things
